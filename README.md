Optimizing Age Gender Prediction on Jetson TX2 using Reinforcement Learning

Pannom, is a real-time embedded system that measures advertisement campaign success in outdoor settings and provides demographic information of passerby’s. In simpler terms, Pannom uses camera footage to detect people that pass by billboards and predict if they were interested in the ad, their age and gender. Pannom uses several deep learning models lined up sequentially, each trained independently, and responsible for different tasks. Currently 3 independent networks are utilized; one for localizing faces, one for localizing facial landmarks, and another for classifying gender and age,. Running 3 deep models on a single embedded chip results in computational overhead, which undermines real-time performance. Nevertheless, we realized that there is room for optimization; intelligent allocation of tasks will improve performance. Currently, Pannom predicts age and gender for every person on every frame and assigns the mean of the predicted labels to each person being tracked. This algorithm consumes a large portion of the computational capacity of the embedded chip. It is more optimal to make predictions until the system is sufficiently confident about the person’s age and gender. By intelligently deciding whether to make a prediction, we intend to decrease the number of predictions, while retaining comparable confidence.
